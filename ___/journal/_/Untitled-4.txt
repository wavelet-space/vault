Generative deep learning models, a class of unsupervised deep learning models, are capable of learning the important
characteristics of a data distribution and generating realistic samples based purely on obser-
vation.


The phase field is in the form of c(x, y, t). We assume a constant di↵usion coe�cient
(D). The ✏ parameter is the energetic penalty on gradients in the concentration field, which
drives the phase segregation process and influences the mean size of single-phase regions.
f(c) is the free energy of the system that is generally selected in the form f(c) = ac2(c�1)2,
