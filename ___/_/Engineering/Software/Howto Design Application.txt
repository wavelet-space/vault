== How to design application 


Start with requirements. This would not be precise detailed description but high level.
Write  down features/use-cases e.g 

As a user I want to 
    download content of some webpage and store them somewhere

This simple use-case imply that we will need to use HTTP request and then use some
storing capacity in the simple case file system.

The application can be command line so it is good to think about some flags e.g 

    program --url <webpage-url> --output <output-folder>
