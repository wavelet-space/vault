## Software Projects

- https://github.com/signals-dev/Orion
  **Orion** is a machine learning library built for unsupervised time series anomaly detection. With a given time series data, we provide a number of “verified” ML pipelines (a.k.a Orion pipelines) that identify rare patterns and flag them for expert review.

- https://github.com/ossu/data-science
  This is a path for those of you who want to complete the Data Science undergraduate curriculum on your own time, for free, with courses from the best universities in the World.

- https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow
  MLflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models
