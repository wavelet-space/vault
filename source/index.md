I want to briefly describe how I write my notes, both digitally and handwritten. These notes were written in MyST Markdown with the help of Sphinx. Because I want some parts to be in one place, e.g., a course, I use git submodules. I will share more about my experience with Spinx and note-taking in 2024.
