  * The rule of  zero voltage in closed circuit.
  * Calculation of current and voltage in a circuit with a source and consumers: resistor, LED, DC-5V

## Components and circuits

* Ennergy source
  * Baterry 9V
  * Custom 5V supply  
* Resistor
* Light emmiting diode (LED)
* Capacitor
* Induktor
* Diode
* Transistor
  There are two main groups of transistors, bipolar and unipolar. The most common are bipolar which
  can be divided to two groups, NPN and PNP. The most common type of bipolar transistor is NPN.
  * Bipolar
    * NPN
    * PNP
  * Unipolar
  * used as switch
  * used as applifiar of signal/current

* Logical gates
  * NOT
  * AND
  * OR
  * XOR
  * NAND

* Laboratory instruments
  * Power supply
  * Multimeter
  * Osciloskop
