* Useful notes on note taking with Sphinx <https://silverrainz.me/notes/docutils/index.html>, <https://github.com/sphinx-notes>.
  * Add to bookmarks and resources!
* Watching WebGL series on Youtube, very well made: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T6EbWCq99c&list=PLPbmjY2NVO_X1U1JzLxLDdRn4NmtxyQQo>  
* For me personaly the bottleneck in terms of productivity is thinking not a writing a code.
* Still evaluating what to learn and use for production systems (alonside Python).
  * Go (simple but verbose), Rust (robust but complex), C++ (flexible but complex<sup>2</sup> and fragmented)?
* For personal projects I'm interested in  APL (K/Q, Dyalog), Forth, Joy, Racket, and Lean. I also like Erlang and OCaml and for some reasons I still don't like Haskell, I really don't.  
* reading about mechs in japanese culture
  * [[idea]] RPG computer game with arena and/or quest story line
* gameplay vs storyline
* *Night on the Galactic Railorad*.
* Install [BrickLink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page)
* The evolution of trees <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfatf-4fGeo>
* Study Doom and Quake source code
* Code quality. Doom and quake are very readable, very portable and heavily documented. The average 1-person codebase tends to be messy and undocumented, as nobody else ever takes a look. On the other hand, plenty of fixmes in there. It was unabashedly special cased where he could get away with it.

* Style guide for C++: <https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/iml661/studio_code_style_guides/>
  We must strictly declare what features and style to use. The same for C -* add examples e.g. how to use anonymous structs/unions.
