- For me personaly the bottleneck in terms of productivity is thinking not a writing a code.
- Still evaluating what to learn and use for production systems (alonside Python).
  - Go (simple but verbose), Rust (robust but complex), C++ (flexible but complex<sup>2</sup> and fragmented)?
- For personal projects I'm interested in  APL (K/Q, Dyalog), Forth, Joy, Racket, and Lean. I also like Erlang and OCaml and for some reasons I still don't like Haskell, I really don't.
