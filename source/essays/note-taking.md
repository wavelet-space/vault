# On note taking

I want to breifly describe I I write my notes both digital and handwritten. This notes are written in [MyST MarkDown](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/myst.html) with the help of [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Because I want some parts to be in one place e.g. *course* I use git submodules. I will share more about my experience on 2024.
