We’ve seen several formulations of a monoid: as a set, as a single-object category, as an
object in a monoidal category. How much more juice can we squeeze out of this simple concept?
Let’s try. Take this definition of a monoid as a set m with a pair of functions:

Monoid je množina M se dvěma operacemi operations

μ :: m × m ⟶ m    # multiplication
η :: 1 ⟶ m        #

1 je singleton set
