# Welcome 

This is my virtual *space*, where I spend a lot of my physical *time*.

**Topics to be covered:** software engineering; scientific programming; computer graphics and physics, algorithmic trading, economy and ecology; and some hobbies e.g. LEGO® MINDSTORMS® and Technic, gaming, painting, sculpting, and literature.

I am currently working hard to get this site to a readable state (the expected date is the end of 2023). Stay tuned.
