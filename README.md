# blog ⍷ code

*Welcome! This is my personal space, where I collect my notes.*

Topics that I want to cover: software engineering best practices; programming languages; scientific programming; physics and mathematics (of course); economy and politics (this world is a complex beast); and some hobbies: LEGO® MINDSTORMS® and Technic, visual arts, and literature.

I am currently working hard to get this site to a readable state (the expected date is the end of 2023). Stay tuned.
