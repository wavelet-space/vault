# Welcome

This is my virtual *space*, where I spend a lot of my physical *time*.

*My goal is to be both concise and accurate. How can one be open and share all one's thoughts and still maintain a certain kind of distance and inaccessibility?*

*I am currently working hard to get this site to a readable state. The expected date is the end of 2023. Stay tuned!*

**Topics to be covered:** software engineering; scientific programming; computer graphics and physics, algorithmic trading, economy and ecology; and some hobbies e.g. LEGO® MINDSTORMS® and Technic, gaming, painting, sculpting, and literature.
