# Welcome

This is my virtual *space*, where I spend a lot of my physical *time*[^1].

*My goal is to be both concise and accurate in my writing.*

*I'm  working hard to get this site to a readable state. The expected date is the end of 2023.*

**Topics:** software engineering; scientific programming; computer graphics and physics, algorithmic trading, economy and ecology; and some hobbies e.g. LEGOÂ® MINDSTORMS and Technic, game mechanics, visual arts, and literature.
